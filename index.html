                <h2>üìú About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    Catalyst-Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology was inaugurated in the year 2013. The Centre aims in sharpening the skills of students, broadening their knowledge base and equipping
                    them with technical and non-technical qualities that an engineer need. We try to inspire young engineers to connect with great people &amp; to explore recent technological developments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than pushing students to startup, the centre believes in inculcating the entrepreneurial spirit in students. The members have identified the true joy of self-learning and they passionately involve in brining life into their ideas, to solve the
                    problems that they see around. Catalyst-Mar Baselios IEDC aims in helping the students follow their dreams and passion to help them depart MBCET campus not just as engineering graduates, but as real engineers who seek and solve problems.
